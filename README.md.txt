# 🧠 Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis and K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies **RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** and **K-Means clustering** to segment customers from a real-world online retail dataset.

The goal is to automatically group customers based on their purchasing behavior to support business decisions in marketing, retention, and sales strategy.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- **Machine Learning**: K-Means Clustering
- **Data Source**: Online Retail dataset (Excel format)
- **Optional Visualization**: Power BI

## 🔍 Business Problem


- Prioritize marketing campaigns
- Improve retention of valuable clients
- Recover inactive or lost customers
- Allocate resources more efficiently

Traditional manual segmentation is limited. This project automates that task using unsupervised learning.

## 🚀 Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed returns, missing customer IDs, and zero/negative values.

2. **RFM Metrics Calculation**  
   - **Recency**: Days since last purchase  
   - **Frequency**: Total transactions per customer  
   - **Monetary**: Total revenue per customer  

3. **Data Normalization**  
   - Applied `StandardScaler` for consistent clustering.

4. **K-Means Clustering**  
   - Used the Elbow Method to determine optimal number of clusters.  
   - Assigned each customer to a segment based on RFM patterns.

5. **Interpretation**  
   - Clusters analyzed and labeled (e.g., High-Value, Lost, Potential, New Customers)

6. *Exported to Power BI for business-level dashboards
